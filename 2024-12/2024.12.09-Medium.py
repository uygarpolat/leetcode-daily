3152. Special Array II

An array is considered special if every pair of its adjacent elements contains two numbers with different parity.

You are given an array of integer nums and a 2D integer matrix queries, where for queries[i] = [fromi, toi] your task is to check that subarray nums[fromi..toi] is special or not.

Return an array of booleans answer such that answer[i] is true if nums[fromi..toi] is special.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,1,2,6], queries = [[0,4]]
Output: [false]
Explanation:
The subarray is [3,4,1,2,6]. 2 and 6 are both even.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,3,1,6], queries = [[0,2],[2,3]]
Output: [false,true]
Explanation:
The subarray is [4,3,1]. 3 and 1 are both odd. So the answer to this query is false.
The subarray is [1,6]. There is only one pair: (1,6) and it contains numbers with different parity. So the answer to this query is true.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 105
1 <= queries.length <= 105
queries[i].length == 2
0 <= queries[i][0] <= queries[i][1] <= nums.length - 1
