386. Lexicographical Numbers

Given an integer n, return all the numbers in the range [1, n] sorted in lexicographical order.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) extra space. 

Example 1:
Input: n = 13
Output: [1,10,11,12,13,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: [1,2]
 
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
