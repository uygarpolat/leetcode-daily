440. K-th Smallest in Lexicographical Order

Given two integers n and k, return the kth lexicographically smallest integer in the range [1, n].

Example 1:
Input: n = 13, k = 2
Output: 10
Explanation: The lexicographical order is [1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], so the second smallest number is 10.

Example 2:
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: 1

Constraints:
1 <= k <= n <= 10^9

			next = current + 1

			while first <= n:
				steps += min(n+1, next) - first
				first *= 10
				next *= 10
			return steps
