3477. Fruits Into Baskets II

You are given two arrays of integers, fruits and baskets, each of length n, where fruits[i] represents the quantity of the ith type of fruit, and baskets[j] represents the capacity of the jth basket.

From left to right, place the fruits according to these rules:

Each fruit type must be placed in the leftmost available basket with a capacity greater than or equal to the quantity of that fruit type.
Each basket can hold only one type of fruit.
If a fruit type cannot be placed in any basket, it remains unplaced.
Return the number of fruit types that remain unplaced after all possible allocations are made.

Example 1:
Input: fruits = [4,2,5], baskets = [3,5,4]
Output: 1
Explanation:
fruits[0] = 4 is placed in baskets[1] = 5.
fruits[1] = 2 is placed in baskets[0] = 3.
fruits[2] = 5 cannot be placed in baskets[2] = 4.
Since one fruit type remains unplaced, we return 1.

Example 2:
Input: fruits = [3,6,1], baskets = [6,4,7]
Output: 0
Explanation:
fruits[0] = 3 is placed in baskets[0] = 6.
fruits[1] = 6 cannot be placed in baskets[1] = 4 (insufficient capacity) but can be placed in the next available basket, baskets[2] = 7.
fruits[2] = 1 is placed in baskets[1] = 4.
Since all fruits are successfully placed, we return 0.

Constraints:
n == fruits.length == baskets.length
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= fruits[i], baskets[i] <= 10^9
