1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element

Given a binary array nums, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's in the resulting array. Return 0 if there is no such subarray.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: After deleting the number in position 2, [1,1,1] contains 3 numbers with value of 1's.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: After deleting the number in position 4, [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1] longest subarray with value of 1's is [1,1,1,1,1].

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: You must delete one element.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
