837. New 21 Game

Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".

Alice starts with 0 points and draws numbers while she has less than k points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, maxPts], where maxPts is an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets k or more points.

Return the probability that Alice has n or fewer points.

Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer are considered accepted.

Example 1:
Input: n = 10, k = 1, maxPts = 10
Output: 1.00000
Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.

Example 2:
Input: n = 6, k = 1, maxPts = 10
Output: 0.60000
Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.
In 6 out of 10 possibilities, she is at or below 6 points.

Example 3:
Input: n = 21, k = 17, maxPts = 10
Output: 0.73278

Constraints:
0 <= k <= n <= 10^4
1 <= maxPts <= 10^4
