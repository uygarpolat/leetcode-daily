28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

Example 2:
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.

Constraints:
1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 10^4
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.

		m = len(needle)
		for i in range(n):
			if haystack[i:i+m] == needle:
				return i
		return -1

	assert solution.strStr("leetcode", "leeto") == -1
