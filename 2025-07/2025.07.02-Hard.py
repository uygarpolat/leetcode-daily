3333. Find the Original Typed String II

Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed multiple times.

You are given a string word, which represents the final output displayed on Alice's screen. You are also given a positive integer k.

Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have intended to type, if she was trying to type a string of size at least k.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:
Input: word = "aabbccdd", k = 7
Output: 5
Explanation:
The possible strings are: "aabbccdd", "aabbccd", "aabbcdd", "aabccdd", and "abbccdd".

Example 2:
Input: word = "aabbccdd", k = 8
Output: 1
Explanation:
The only possible string is "aabbccdd".

Example 3:
Input: word = "aaabbb", k = 3
Output: 8

Constraints:
1 <= word.length <= 5 * 10^5
word consists only of lowercase English letters.
1 <= k <= 2000
