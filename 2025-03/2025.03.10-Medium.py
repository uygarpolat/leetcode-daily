3306. Count of Substrings Containing Every Vowel and K Consonants II

You are given a string word and a non-negative integer k.

Return the total number of substrings of word that contain every vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u') at least once and exactly k consonants.

Example 1:
Input: word = "aeioqq", k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation:
There is no substring with every vowel.

Example 2:
Input: word = "aeiou", k = 0
Output: 1
Explanation:
The only substring with every vowel and zero consonants is word[0..4], which is "aeiou".

Example 3:
Input: word = "ieaouqqieaouqq", k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation:
The substrings with every vowel and one consonant are:
word[0..5], which is "ieaouq".
word[6..11], which is "qieaou".
word[7..12], which is "ieaouq".
 
Constraints:
5 <= word.length <= 2 * 10^5
word consists only of lowercase English letters.
0 <= k <= word.length - 5
