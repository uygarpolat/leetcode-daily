1980. Find Unique Binary String

Given an array of strings nums containing n unique binary strings each of length n, return a binary string of length n that does not appear in nums. If there are multiple answers, you may return any of them.

Example 1:
Input: nums = ["01","10"]
Output: "11"
Explanation: "11" does not appear in nums. "00" would also be correct.

Example 2:
Input: nums = ["00","01"]
Output: "11"
Explanation: "11" does not appear in nums. "10" would also be correct.

Example 3:
Input: nums = ["111","011","001"]
Output: "101"
Explanation: "101" does not appear in nums. "000", "010", "100", and "110" would also be correct.

Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 16
nums[i].length == n
nums[i] is either '0' or '1'.
All the strings of nums are unique.
