3174. Clear Digits

You are given a string s.

Your task is to remove all digits by doing this operation repeatedly:

Delete the first digit and the closest non-digit character to its left.
Return the resulting string after removing all digits.

Note that the operation cannot be performed on a digit that does not have any non-digit character to its left.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abc"
Output: "abc"
Explanation:
There is no digit in the string.

Example 2:
Input: s = "cb34"
Output: ""
Explanation:
First, we apply the operation on s[2], and s becomes "c4".
Then we apply the operation on s[1], and s becomes "".

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of lowercase English letters and digits.
The input is generated such that it is possible to delete all digits.
