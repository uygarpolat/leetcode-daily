539. Minimum Time Difference

Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "HH:MM" format, return the minimum minutes difference between any two time-points in the list.

Example 1:
Input: timePoints = ["23:59","00:00"]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: timePoints = ["00:00","23:59","00:00"]
Output: 0

Constraints:
2 <= timePoints.length <= 2 * 10^4
timePoints[i] is in the format "HH:MM".
