1317. Convert Integer to the Sum of Two No-Zero Integers

No-Zero integer is a positive integer that does not contain any 0 in its decimal representation.

Given an integer n, return a list of two integers [a, b] where:

a and b are No-Zero integers.
a + b = n
The test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions, you can return any of them.

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: [1,1]
Explanation: Let a = 1 and b = 1.
Both a and b are no-zero integers, and a + b = 2 = n.

Example 2:
Input: n = 11
Output: [2,9]
Explanation: Let a = 2 and b = 9.
Both a and b are no-zero integers, and a + b = 11 = n.
Note that there are other valid answers as [8, 3] that can be accepted.

Constraints:
2 <= n <= 10^4
