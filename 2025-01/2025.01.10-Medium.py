916. Word Subsets

You are given two string arrays words1 and words2.

A string b is a subset of string a if every letter in b occurs in a including multiplicity.

For example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior" but is not a subset of "world".
A string a from words1 is universal if for every string b in words2, b is a subset of a.

Return an array of all the universal strings in words1. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["e","o"]
Output: ["facebook","google","leetcode"]

Example 2:
Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["lc","eo"]
Output: ["leetcode"]

Example 3:
Input: words1 = ["acaac","cccbb","aacbb","caacc","bcbbb"], words2 = ["c","cc","b"]
Output: ["cccbb"]

Constraints:
1 <= words1.length, words2.length <= 10^4
1 <= words1[i].length, words2[i].length <= 10
words1[i] and words2[i] consist only of lowercase English letters.
All the strings of words1 are unique.
